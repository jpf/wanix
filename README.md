* Abstract POSIX process model for generalized compute execution
* Per-process namespaces for security, isolation, and custom environments
* Built-in emulator for x86 support, Linux compatibility, and Docker-like functionality
* Runs in the browser as well as natively on Mac, Windows, and Linux
* Web: File interfaces for OPFS, DOM, web workers, and service workers
* Web: Runs WASI WebAssembly *and* x86 executables

### Example Uses

* Embed systems software and development tools in web applications
* Experiment with Plan 9 capabilities in browser or natively
* Use as foundation for a modern web-native operating system

## Contributing

We are currently developing a roadmap to convey the direction we're exploring with Wanix, but this is an open and modular project that you can take and experiment with for your own purposes.

Take a look at our [issues](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix/issues) to see how you can help out. You can also ask questions and participate in [discussions](https://github.com/tractordev/wanix/discussions), however right now most discussion takes place in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nbrwNXVvVa).
